StorageOS can interface with Kubernetes using the native storage drivers or
the new
[CSI](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/01/introducing-container-storage-interface/)
interface.  __For {{ page.k8s-version }}, we recommend the StorageOS Operator
install using native drivers, unless you have a specific requirement.__

{% include k8s/custom-install.md %}


## CSI Note

Kubernetes 1.12 introduces significant changes to CSI, therefore it is
recommended to deploy with Helm as it manages the complexity of those changes
transparently. A non Helm installation will be available shortly.

CSI allows you to set StorageOS features (`storageos.com/*` labels) on the
StorageClass, but not PVCs. If you need to set labels on PVCs or your
environment does not support CSI, you may install StorageOS without CSI.
