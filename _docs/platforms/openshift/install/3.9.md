# OpenShift 3.9+

The recommended way to run StorageOS on an OpenShift 3.9+ cluster is to deploy
a daemonset with RBAC support.

## Prerequisites

You will need an OpenShift cluster with Beta APIs enabled.

1. Ensure any firewalls permit the [appropriate ports]({% link _docs/prerequisites/firewalls.md %})
1. Ensure that your docker installation has mount propagation enabled per our
   [mount propagation prerequisites]({% link _docs/prerequisites/mountpropagation.md %})
1. Enable the `MountPropagation` flag by appending feature gates to the api and controller (you can apply these changes using the Ansible Playbooks)

>Note: If you are using atomic installation rather than origin, the location of the yaml config files and service names might change.

- Add to the KubernetesMasterConfig section (/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml):

    ```bash
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiServerArguments:
      feature-gates:
      - MountPropagation=true
  controllerArguments:
      feature-gates:
      - MountPropagation=true
    ```

- Add to the feature-gates to the kubelet arguments (/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml):

    ```bash
kubeletArguments:
    feature-gates:
    - MountPropagation=true
    ```

- **Warning:** Restarting OpenShift services can cause downtime in the cluster.
- Restart services in the MasterNode `origin-master-api.service`, `origin-master-controllers.service` and `origin-node.service`
- Restart service in all Nodes `origin-node.service`
