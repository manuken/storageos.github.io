# Docker

StorageOS can install as a standalone [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
container, and be used to provide permanent storage for other containers.

Although we do not recommend a Docker only production environment, you can use
Docker to quickly establish a test environment. In the cookbooks that follow we
have included examples of how to setup several stateful applications.
