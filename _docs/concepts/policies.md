# Policies

StorageOS policies are a way to control user and group access to StorageOS
[Namespaces]({%link _docs/concepts/namespaces.md %}). To grant a user or group
access to a namespace, a policy needs to be created mapping the user or group
to the namespace. 

>Note: Users always have access to the default namespace

For more information on how to use policies, see the [Policies operations]({%link _docs/operations/policies.md %})
page
