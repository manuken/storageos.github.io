# Policies

StorageOS policies are a way to control user and group access to StorageOS
[Namespaces]({%link _docs/concepts/namespaces.md %}). A user or group has access
to a namespace, other than the default namespace, if a policy is created
mapping the user or group to the namespace. 

For more information on how to use polcies, see the [Policies
operations]({LINK TO DO}) page
