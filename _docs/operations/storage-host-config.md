# Storage host configuration

StorageOS saves data in the hosts where it is present. The StorageOS directory
is `/var/lib/storageos`. Where not only raw data is stored, but also
relevant metadata. 

It is recommended to isolate the `/var/lib/storageos` directory from the root
filesystem. Default installations of StorageOS will use `/` as a data store. In
the event of filling the partition, the OS can stop functioning normally.
Therefore, it is best to mount a different device or partition for that
directory. StorageOS is agnostic to the filesystem mounted in
`/var/lib/storageos`. 

In addition, StorageOS can extend the storage available for StorageOS volumes.
It is possible to use different disks or partitions to expand StorageOSâ€™
available space. By default, the directory `/var/lib/storageos/data/dev1` will be
created when volumes are used. However, it is possible to shard the data files
by creating more directories alike. StorageOS will save data in any directory
that follows the name `dev[0-9]+`, such as `/var/lib/storageos/data/dev2` or
`/var/lib/storageos/data/dev5`. This functionality enables operators to mount
different devices into `devX` directories and StorageOS will recognise them as
available storage automatically. For more information about how to extend
available storage and different options available, check the [Extend Storage
Capacity]({%link _docs/operations/extend-storage.md %}) page.
