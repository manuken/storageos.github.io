## Setup of storage on the hosts

We recommend creating a separate filesystem for StorageOS to mitigate
risk of filling the root filesystem on nodes. This has to be done for each node
in the cluster.

Follow the [managing host storage]({%link _docs/operations/managing-host-storage.md
%}) best practices page for more details.
