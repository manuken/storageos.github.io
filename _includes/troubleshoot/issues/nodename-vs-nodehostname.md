## Node name different from Hostname

#### Issue:

StorageOS nodes can't join the cluster showing the following log entries.

```bash
time="2018-09-24T13:47:02Z" level=error msg="failed to start api" error="error verifying UUID: UUID aed3275f-846b-1f75-43a1-adbfec8bf974 has already been registered and has hostname 'debian-4', not 'node4'" module=command
```

### Reason:

The StorageOS registration process to start the cluster uses the hostname of
the node where StorageOS container is running, provided by {{ page.platform }}.
However, StorageOS verifies the network hostname of the OS as a prestart check
to make sure it can communicate with other nodes. If those 2 names don't match,
StorageOS will remain unable to start.

### Solution:

Make sure the hostnames match with the {{ page.platform }} advertised names. If
you have changed the hostname of your nodes, make sure that you restart the
nodes to apply the change.
